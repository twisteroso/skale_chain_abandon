# SKALE — Chain Abandon Tracker

Monitors the SKALE Manager contract for **massive fund withdrawals** (> $10M) from any individual SKALE app-chain back to Ethereum.

This is not profit-taking.  
This is **shutting down an entire blockchain**.

When a project pays millions to run its own chain —  
and then pulls everything out —  
the chain becomes a ghost town overnight.

## Run

```bash
python skale_chain_abandon.py
